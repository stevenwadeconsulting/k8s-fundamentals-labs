# üë®‚Äçüè´ About Your Instructor

Hey :wave: ! I'm Steve Wade, and I'm excited to be your instructor for this Kubernetes workshop. With a passion for cloud-native technologies and a commitment to sharing knowledge, I aim to make this workshop an engaging and informative experience.

## üöÄ Professional Background

I am an industry veteran with extensive experience in cloud-native technologies, having worked with Kubernetes since version 1.2 (circa 2016). With nearly a decade of hands-on Kubernetes experience, I've witnessed and participated in its evolution from an emerging technology to the industry standard for container orchestration.

My journey with Kubernetes has included:

- Implementing production Kubernetes clusters across various environments (on-premises and the major cloud providers)
- Designing and deploying microservice architectures for enterprises across multiple industries
- Contributing to the Kubernetes ecosystem through open-source work
- Training thousands of professionals worldwide on Kubernetes fundamentals and advanced concepts

## üåê Cloud Native Community Contributions

I'm deeply involved in the Cloud Native ecosystem:

- **Former Flux Maintainer**: I served as a maintainer for [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), the CNCF's Graduated GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
- **Founder of the Cloud Native Club**: A community dedicated to knowledge sharing and collaboration in the cloud native space (join [here](https://join.slack.com/t/the-cloud-native-club/shared_invite/zt-335xi7jth-FV6vX0DQcfrwlab~Vx~WyQ))
- **Content Creator**: I produce educational content for the community including:
  - [My Spotlight Series](https://www.youtube.com/@thecloudnativeclub/playlists) - Highlighting important CNCF projects and their use cases
  - [My Journey Series](https://www.youtube.com/@thecloudnativeclub/playlists) - Interviews with cloud native legends like Joe Beda and Whitney Lee about their experiences with cloud native technology

## üè¢ Industry Experience

My work with Kubernetes spans multiple sectors, including:

- **Financial Services**: Implementing secure, compliant Kubernetes platforms for banking applications
- **Healthcare**: Building HIPAA-compliant container orchestration solutions
- **E-commerce**: Scaling systems to handle variable traffic loads and seasonal peaks
- **Technology**: Helping tech companies modernize their infrastructure with Kubernetes

## üß† Teaching Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. My workshops focus on practical, hands-on experience that mirrors real-world scenarios. My teaching approach emphasizes:

- Building a strong conceptual foundation before diving into complex topics
- Connecting theory to practical applications
- Creating safe spaces to experiment and learn from mistakes
- Offering real-world insights that go beyond documentation

## üéØ Workshop Goals

My goal for this workshop is not just to teach you Kubernetes commands, but to help you understand:

- The underlying architecture and design principles of Kubernetes
- How to approach problem-solving in Kubernetes environments
- Best practices for implementing Kubernetes in production
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

By the end of our time together, you'll have the practical skills and conceptual framework to confidently work with Kubernetes in your own environments.
