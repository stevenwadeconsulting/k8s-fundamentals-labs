# About Your Instructor

## Professional Background

Hey :wave: I'm Steven Wade, and I'm excited to be your instructor for this Kubernetes workshop!

I am an industry veteran with extensive experience in cloud-native technologies, having worked with Kubernetes since version 1.2 (circa 2016). With nearly a decade of hands-on Kubernetes experience, I've witnessed and participated in its evolution from an emerging technology to the industry standard for container orchestration.

My journey with Kubernetes has included:

- Implementing production Kubernetes clusters across various environments (on-premises, AWS, GCP, Azure, and Digital Ocean)
- Designing and deploying microservice architectures for enterprises across multiple industries
- Contributing to the Kubernetes ecosystem through open-source work
- Training thousands of professionals worldwide on Kubernetes fundamentals and advanced concepts

## Industry Experience

My work with Kubernetes spans multiple sectors, including:

- **Financial Services**: Implementing secure, compliant Kubernetes platforms for banking applications
- **Healthcare**: Building HIPAA-compliant container orchestration solutions
- **E-commerce**: Scaling systems to handle variable traffic loads and seasonal peaks
- **Technology**: Helping tech companies modernize their infrastructure with Kubernetes

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. My workshops focus on practical, hands-on experience that mirrors real-world scenarios. My teaching approach emphasises:

- Building a strong conceptual foundation before diving into complex topics
- Connecting theory to practical applications
- Creating safe spaces to experiment and learn from mistakes
- Offering real-world insights that go beyond documentation

## Workshop Goals

My goal for this workshop is not just to teach you Kubernetes commands, but to help you understand:

- The underlying architecture and design principles of Kubernetes
- How to approach problem-solving in Kubernetes environments
- Best practices for implementing Kubernetes in production
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

By the end of our time together, you'll have the practical skills and conceptual framework to confidently work with Kubernetes in your own environments.
